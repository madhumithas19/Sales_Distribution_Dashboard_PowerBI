# Sales Distribution Dashboard | Power BI Project

In this project, I built an interactive sales dashboard using Power BI to help track sales distribution patterns across different dimensions.
The report is ideal for management to monitor actual performance, compare against targets, and evaluate top contributors.

## Objectives
- Understand monthly trends in sales vs. target
- Identify top-performing products and regions
- Discover global sales distribution using map visuals
- Track weekly sales patterns and customer contribution

## Visualizations Used
- KPI Card for Total Sales
- Donut Chart (Sales by Region)
- Clustered Column Chart (Monthly Performance)
- Area Chart (Weekly Sales)
- Bar Chart (Top Products)
- Map (Sales by Country)
- Table (Top Customers)
- Calendar-style month filters

## Technologies & Concepts
- Power BI Desktop
- Data modeling & transformation
- DAX for KPIs and custom calculations
- Bookmarking & interaction handling
